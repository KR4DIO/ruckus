It would be very nice to be able to inspect properties of the distance field.
And possibly have them influence other parts of the field!

It seems pretty easy to provide "virtual calipers" that, given a line through
the model, measure the solid extent of the model along the line.  It could be
done efficiently using sphere tracing, or analytically with a root finder.

Measuring the extent along an axis but *not* necessarily along a single line
seems harder...
